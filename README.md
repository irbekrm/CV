Aspiring developer who wants to work in a team to tackle challenging projects, write quality software and master new skills.
Currently actively looking for a job.

## Background

I started coding as a hobby after playing around with a code snippet on a holiday and becoming fascinated by how you can make it do different things by only changing a few keywords or values. I then spent a lot of time on Codewars, trying to write short and fast solutions to katas.
Makers Academy taught me a lot about how the actual software development works as well as how to create quality code that can be easily maintained, extended and used by others.

### Personal Skills

#### Patient learner

At college between the subjects I studied was academic drawing and painting. Studying these can be a slow and sometimes frustrating process. You spend hours in front of your drawing board trying to create an image of some arrangement of objects or a fragment of marble. Sometimes your teacher will come and look at your work and tell you where you should improve. But the things they might be saying- that the colour of a shadow is warm under electrical light, but cool under natural light or that a shadow reflects a colour of nearby objects- are not necessarily going to make any sense initially. The learning process involves training your vision as well as learning the theory and practicing regularly. If you stop drawing and painting for a few weeks, it will take a while to get back to the previous skill level.

I still remember that excitement when after about a year I started understanding and actually seeing the things that teachers where talking about and produced a quite well crafted and effortless looking still life painting.

But the main takeaway from all these years for me are the general skills of learning a craft. That your progress is likely to be very slow at times, but continuous practice is crucial nevertheless. That the criteria of quality work that you should follow might initially make no sense- your understanding of what is a quality work will also probably change as you learn. That the satisfaction of having produced quality work makes all the effort so very much worth it.

#### Problem solver

At Makers Academy I was once complaining to a coursemate that I didn't get as much done on that day as I wanted to. I got a response 'Of course, because when someone asks you if you know how to solve an issue, you leave your own task and start coding with them'. The coursemate was right- if I see an interesting problem, be it a weird error or a technical challenge, or a tricky Codewars kata, I find myself to be still thinking about it hours and days later and trying various solutions.
