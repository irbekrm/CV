### Personal Skills

#### Patient learner

At college between the subjects I studied was academic drawing and painting. Studying these can be slow and sometimes frustrating process. You spend hours in front of your drawing board trying to create an image of some arrangement of objects or a fragment of marble. Sometimes your teacher will come and look at your work and tell you where you should improve. But the things they might be saying- that the colour of a shadow is warm under electrical light, but cool under natural light or that a shadow reflects a colour of nearby objects- are not necessarily going to make any sense initially. The learning process involves training your vision as well as learning the theory and practicing regularly. If you stop drawing and painting for a few weeks, it will take a while to get back to the previous skill level.
I still remember that excitement when after about a year I started understanding and actually seeing the things that teachers where talking about and produced a quite well crafted and effortless looking still life painting.

But the main takeaway from all these years for me are the general skills of learning a craft. That your progress is likely to be very slow at times, but continuous practice is crucial nevertheless. That the criteria of quality work that you should follow might initially make no sense- your understanding of what is a quality work will also probably change as you learn. That the satisfaction of having produced quality work makes all the effort so very much worth it.
